        Armenia is&nbsp;located in&nbsp;the South Caucasus region of&nbsp;Eurasia, bordered by&nbsp;Georgia to&nbsp;the
        north, Azerbaijan to&nbsp;the east, Iran to&nbsp;the south, and Turkey to&nbsp;the west. Its capital and largest
        city is&nbsp;Yerevan.
        Armenia has a&nbsp;rich history and cultural heritage, with evidence of&nbsp;human settlement in&nbsp;the region
        dating back to&nbsp;the Neolithic era. The Kingdom of&nbsp;Armenia was established in&nbsp;the 6th century BCE,
        and at&nbsp;its height, it&nbsp;spanned from the Mediterranean Sea to&nbsp;the Caspian Sea. Over the centuries,
        Armenia was invaded and ruled by&nbsp;various empires, including the Roman, Byzantine, Arab, Persian, and
        Ottoman empires.
        Armenia became part of&nbsp;the Soviet Union in&nbsp;1922 and gained independence in&nbsp;1991 following the
        collapse of&nbsp;the Soviet Union. Today, Armenia is&nbsp;a&nbsp;parliamentary republic with a&nbsp;population
        of&nbsp;approximately 3&nbsp;million people. The country is&nbsp;known for its ancient monasteries, stunning
        landscapes, and delicious cuisine, including dishes like lavash (flatbread) and dolma (stuffed grape leaves).

            The Kingdom of&nbsp;Armenia was the first nation to&nbsp;adopt Christianity as&nbsp;its official religion
            in&nbsp;301&nbsp;AD. That legacy lives on&nbsp;in&nbsp;the 4,000-plus Armenian Apostolic churches and
            monasteries throughout the country.
          </p>
          <p class="place__paragraph">
            Armenia is&nbsp;world-renowned for its unique ecclesiastical architecture. Because Christianity has been
            around for so&nbsp;long, it&nbsp;has entirely naturally become interwoven with Armenian identity and
            influences almost every aspect of&nbsp;local culture, especially architecture.
